## Overview

This app was created using React, Redux, and CSS. A simple frontend application that has all the functionalities of a traditional restaurant website. 

It has a minimalistic design with a simple UI for users to easily navigate. I used Redux for state management to keep track of items that users will be ordering. 

This is a fully responsive application from mobile to 4k.
